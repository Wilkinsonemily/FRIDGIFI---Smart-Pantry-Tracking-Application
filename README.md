FRIDGIFI is an AI-powered smart pantry tracking application designed to help users manage their pantry inventory, reduce food waste, and track expenses. It acts as a personalized shopping assistant, providing reminders and recommendations based on available groceries, expiration dates, and spending habits.

## üìñ Background

Many users struggle with tracking groceries, avoiding duplicate purchases, and managing monthly food budgets. Through a survey of 40 participants, we found that an average of 73% often forget what they have at home, overspend, or buy unnecessary items. FRIDGIFI addresses these problems by providing automated reminders, AI-based image recognition for pantry items, and smart notifications to manage inventory effectively.
